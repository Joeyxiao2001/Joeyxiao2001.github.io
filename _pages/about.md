About this page
================================================
Hello fellows! Welcome to my personal corner on the web! My name is Yuhan Xiao and I usually just go by Joey, I'm thrilled to have you here! This website is about a reflection of my passions, experiences, and aspirations, where I hope to connect with like-minded individuals and share my journey through life.

I am a programmer enthusiast with a keen interest in Game Development. I graduated from NC State with a degree in Computer Science, and ever since, I have been constantly exploring new avenues to learn, grow, and make a difference in my field.

Apart from my professional pursuits, I am an ardent lover of music, which allows me to maintain a healthy work-life balance and indulge in creative self-expression. You'll often find me by the piano in my free time or catching up on the latest trends and innovations in my field.

This website serves as a platform for me to document my personal and professional milestones, as well as share my insights, experiences, and the lessons I've learned along the way. Through my blog, I aim to inspire, inform, and engage with others who share similar interests, and together, we can embark on a journey of growth and self-discovery.

Feel free to explore my portfolio, browse through my blog posts, and don't hesitate to get in touch with me through the contact page. I'd love to hear your thoughts, ideas, or simply have a conversation.

Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy your time here.

Warm regards,

Joey
